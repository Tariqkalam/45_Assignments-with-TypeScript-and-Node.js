// Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent
//  if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
let favorite_fruits: string[] = ['Apple', 'Bannana', 'Pear'];

// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array.
//  If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
if(favorite_fruits.includes('Apple')) {
    console.log('I really like Apple!');

if(favorite_fruits.includes('Bannana')) {
    console.log('I really like Banana!');
}

if(favorite_fruits.includes('Pear')) {
